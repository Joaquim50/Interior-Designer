    challenge:
      "The client wanted to transform a dated penthouse into a contemporary sanctuary that maximized natural light while maintaining privacy. The existing layout felt cramped despite the generous square footage, and the space lacked a cohesive design language.",
    solution:
      "We reimagined the floor plan with an open-concept design, removing unnecessary walls to create fluid transitions between living spaces. Custom millwork and built-in storage solutions maximized functionality without sacrificing aesthetics. A curated palette of natural materials—marble, oak, and brushed brass—brought warmth and sophistication. Floor-to-ceiling windows were fitted with automated sheer curtains, balancing light control with unobstructed city views.",
    result:
      "The transformation exceeded expectations, creating a light-filled, elegant home that feels both expansive and intimate. The client now enjoys seamless entertaining spaces and private retreats, all unified by timeless design. The penthouse has become a true reflection of their lifestyle and taste.",

Custom fixtures and carefully zoned areas guide customers through a curated journey. Rich materials like polished concrete and brass accents reinforce the luxury positioning.",
